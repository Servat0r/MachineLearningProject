We used a minibatch SGD with momentum and L2 regularization over several Neural Networks with 2 hidden layers (type A).
We ran a couple of coarse-grained Grid Searches with 3-fold cross-validation, followed by a finer-grained Grid Search
with 4-fold cross-validation and selected the model that performed best on the validation set.
