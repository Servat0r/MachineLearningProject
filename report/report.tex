\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The aim of this report is to illustrate the implementation and testing of a framework for creation and usage of basic Neural Networks.
  We have implemented this framework in Python by exploiting the NumPy numerical library, with a focus on modularity and extensibility of the code.
  We have used the MONK and the ML-CUP22 datasets for testing this framework against respectively classification and regression problems.
  Model selection is implemented as a Grid Search with Holdout and K-fold as validation techniques.
