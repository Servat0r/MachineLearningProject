\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Final Remarks}
This project gave us the opportunity to have an hands-on experience both in the implementation of a Neural Network and in experimenting model selection and training. We had the possibility to draw inspiration from industry-standard tools and to make design and implementation comparisons between them for our own implementation. We had the possibility to better understand the main theoretical contents of the course through implementation and debugging, for example of the backpropagation algorithm. Similarly, we learnt a lot on how to do model selection and validation from our first attempts to our final version, comparing different strategies and reflecting on how to use techniques like k-fold cross validation and searches results to identify the most promising intervals for hyperparameters. Overall it was a great experience, and we learnt a lot from it.

\subsection{Blind Test Set Results}
Blind test set results are contained in the file \texttt{TheBishops\_ML-CUP22-TS.csv} in the \texttt{results} folder of the project package. Our team name is \textbf{The Bishops}.

\subsection{Agreement}
\noindent\textit{We agree to the disclosure and publication of our names, and of the results with preliminary and final ranking.}
